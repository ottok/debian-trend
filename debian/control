Description: general-purpose, efficient trend graph
 trend is a general-purpose, efficient trend graph for "live" data. Data
 is read in ASCII form from a file or continuously from a FIFO and
 displayed in real-time into a multi-pass trend (much like a CRT
 oscilloscope). trend can be used as a rapid analysis tool for
 progressive or time-based data series together with trivial scripting.
